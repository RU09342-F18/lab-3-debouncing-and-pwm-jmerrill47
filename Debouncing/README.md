# Software Debouncing
The goal for this assignment was to get rid of the inevitable bouncing that happens when a button is press on one of the Dev boards.  This bouncing causes the button to toggle more times then you intended and lead to results that are not accurate.  

## Step by Step Process
Just like every other program, the initial statments set up the rest of the program.  The watchdog timer was turned off, P1.0 (Red LED) was set to output to test the program, and the resistor on the button was enabled and set to pull up so when the button is pressed, the circuit is complete and caused P1.0 to toggle.  The reason this program works is because of the interrupts which are all enabled and set up during the second part of the initial code.  Lastly, the two interrupt function are created.  The first being the interrupt that happens when the button is pressed.  First, it toggles the LED, and right after disables the button's ability to cause an interrupt.  Once this happens a clock is created which runs for a set time (CCR0) so that none of the button state changes are resistored.  In the timer interrupt (the second interrupt), the button interrupt is reenabled, the clock is turned off and clear and lastly the button's interrupt flags are cleared to completely reset the interrupt.  This allows the button to repeat this interrupt after it's already been called and allow for a continously debouncing button.
